         <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
         <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
         <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
         <li>1 ⅓ cups white sugar</li>
         <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
         <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
         <li>½ cup melted butter</li>
         <li>2 large eggs</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
         <li>1 ½ cups frozen blueberries</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
         <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 16 muffin cups with paper liners.</li>
         <li>Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.</li>
         <li>Combine sugar, milk, sour cream, butter, eggs, and lemon zest in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed until blended. Fold in the flour mixture until batter is just moistened. Fold in blueberries; avoid overmixing because batter will turn purple.</li>
         <li>Fill muffin cups 3/4 full of batter.</li>
         <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes.</li>
